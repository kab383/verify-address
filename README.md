# Verify Address
This application was built as a personal project. It is not intended for commercial use, but only to display what I have learned in Angular.
Verify Address takes input from the user, and verifies that the input matches the address on record at USPS. If the address does not match entirely, the USPS Verify Address API will make corrections and show the user the true, verified address.

## Learning Highlights
### I learned how to...
1. Properly assemble the file structure of a basic Angular project.
2. Import and use packages that give the ability to utilize additional tools in Angular.
3. Mesh my current knowledge of HTML with Angular syntax to write functional component files.
4. Create the service structure that allows the application to communicate with HTTP protocol.
5. Parse xml to DOM content that could be manipulated with JavaScript queries.
6. Better use in-line styling with Bootstrap.
and much more...
